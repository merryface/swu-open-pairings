# SWU Open Pairings

A small web project for SWU open pairings. This project was "lazy dev-'d."

## What this is

This repository contains a simple front-end application for generating or displaying open pairings (tournament pairings or similar). It's an HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that runs entirely in the browser—no build step or backend required.

## Files

- `index.html` — Main HTML file. Open this in a browser to run the app.
- `styles.css` — Project styles.
- `app.js` — Primary app logic (current file in editor).
- `index.js` — Secondary script (if present) used for additional behavior or bootstrapping.

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `open` on macOS):

   open index.html

2. The app runs in the browser; use the UI to interact with pairings.

## Development

- No dependencies or package manager required.
- If you want to test changes quickly, edit the JS/CSS files and refresh the browser.
